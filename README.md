# Online Antique-Marketplace

## INSPIRATION
## We've always had the desire to own Vintage and exclusive collectibles, but never really had the right platform. So we created one ;)

## What it does
MVP of e-commerce platform, where the sellers put up their exclusive items and the customers can choose from a variety of them under various categories. 

## How we built it
We used Materialize CSS, HTML for the frontend and PHP for the backend. The database we considered was MYSQL because of its robustness.

## Challenges we ran into
It took a lot of sleepless nights, to formulate and implement the file handling as most of our project involves images to be fetched from various folders.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
When we tried to look for such existing platforms on the internet, to our disappointment there weren't many and the very few we found did not have an impressive UI. Thus we feel proud to implement a niche-specific platform.

## What we learned
It was Gurleen's first time with HTML, Materialize CSS,  Arshdeep had prior knowledge of PHP but still learnt a lot of things such as file handling and fetching data in a way that is appropriate for the UI.

## What's next for Online Antique Marketplace
For future scope we plan to integrate Blockchain to it, to enable tokenization of the collectibles and online auction.
